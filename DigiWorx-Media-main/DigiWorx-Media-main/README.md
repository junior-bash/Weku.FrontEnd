# DigiWorx Portfolio Website
This repository contains my code for the DigiWorx portfolio website, which is a front-end version of a movie/series streaming website. I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my design skills and to provide a portfolio website for potential clients or employers to view.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my design skills and provide a portfolio website for potential clients or employers to view.

## Features
The website includes a landing page, a page showcasing my work, and a login modal that appears when the user clicks on the "Login" button in the navigation menu.

I implemented the login modal using JavaScript, and it includes a close button and the ability to close the modal when the user clicks outside of it.

## Future Plans
I plan to continue updating the website and adding more features to it over time.

## How to Use
To view the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

To login, click on the "Login" button in the navigation menu, and the login modal will appear. Enter a username and password (for demonstration purposes, any values can be entered), and click the "Login" button.

To close the login modal, click on the close button or click outside of the modal.

### Credits
The website was designed and developed by Khulekani Shaun Mpanza. Any questions or feedback can be directed to khulekani.zondi704@gmail.com.
